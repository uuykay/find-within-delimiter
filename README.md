# Find within delimiter

This is a utility to be able to find words between delimiters that you define. I created this as an alternative to delimiter-finder which I found could not find words between delimiters that were on new lines. My use case was in reading Markdown files, and replacing some delimiters I had created for myself.

Benefits of this package:

- ✔️ No dependencies
- ✔️ Efficient (no unnecessary class being created for usage).
- ✔️ Supports finding words between delimiters on new lines.
- ✔️ Supports case sensitive (default) or case insensitive delimiter matches.
